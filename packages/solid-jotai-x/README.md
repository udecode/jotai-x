# JotaiX

JotaiX is a custom extension of [Jotai](https://github.com/pmndrs/jotai), a primitive and flexible state management library for React. Jotai offers a
minimalistic API to manage global, derived, or async states in React, solving common issues such as unnecessary
re-renders or complex context management. JotaiX builds upon this foundation, providing enhanced utilities and patterns
for more efficient and streamlined state management in larger and more complex applications.

`jotai-x`, built on top of `jotai`, is providing a powerful store factory
which solves these challenges, so you can focus on your app.

```bash
yarn add jotai jotai-x
```

## **Why Choose `jotai-x`?**

- Reduces boilerplate: Simplifies state management with concise and powerful utilities.
- Enhanced modular state management: Offers advanced features like atom stores, hydration utilities, and more.
- Improved developer experience: Strong TypeScript support ensures type safety and better developer tooling.
- Seamless integration with Jotai: Builds on top of Jotai's API, making it easy for existing Jotai users to adopt.

## **Core Features**

### **Creating a Store**

JotaiX allows for the creation of structured stores with ease, integrating seamlessly with Jotai's atom concept.

```tsx
import { createAtomStore } from 'jotai-x';

// Notice how it uses the name of the store in the returned object.
export const { useElementStore, ElementProvider } = createAtomStore({ 
  element: null
}, { 
  name: 'element'
});
```

The **`createAtomStore`** function simplifies the process of creating and managing atom-based states.

#### Function Signature

```tsx
createAtomStore<T extends object>(initialState: T, options?: CreateAtomStoreOptions): AtomStoreApi;
```

- **`initialState`**: This is an object representing the initial state of your store. Each key-value pair in this object is used to create an individual atom. This is required even if you want to set the initial value from the provider, otherwise the atom would not be created. 
- **`options`**: Optional. This parameter allows you to pass additional configuration options for the store creation.

#### Options

The **`options`** object can include several properties to customize the behavior of your store:

- **`name`**: A string representing the name of the store, which can be helpful for debugging or when working with multiple stores.
- **`delay`**: If you need to introduce a delay in state updates, you can specify it here. Optional.
- **`effect`**: A React component that can be used to run effects inside the provider. Optional.
- **`extend`**: Extend the store with derived atoms based on the store state. Optional.

#### Return Value

The **`createAtomStore`** function returns an object (**`AtomStoreApi`**) containing the following properties and methods for interacting with the store:

- **`use<Name>Store`**: 
  - A function that returns the following objects: **`get`**, **`set`**, **`use`** and **`store`**, where values are hooks for each state defined in the store.
  - **`get`**: Hooks for accessing a state within a component,  ensuring re-rendering when the state changes. See [useAtomValue](https://jotai.org/docs/core/use-atom#useatomvalue).
  - **`set`**: Hooks for setting a state within a component. See [useSetAtom](https://jotai.org/docs/core/use-atom#usesetatom).
  - **`use`**: Hooks for accessing and setting a state within a component, ensuring re-rendering when the state changes. See [useAtom](https://jotai.org/docs/core/use-atom).
  - **`store`**: A hook to access the [JotaiStore](https://jotai.org/docs/core/store) for the current context.
  - Example: `const [element, setElement] = useElementStore().use.element()`
- **`<Name>Provider`**:
  - The API includes dynamically generated provider components for each defined store. This allows  scoped state management within your application. More information in the next section.
- **`<name>Store`**:
  - **`atom`**: Access the atoms used by the store, including derived atoms defined using `extend`. See [atom](https://jotai.org/docs/core/atom).
  
### **Provider-Based Store Hydration and Synchronization**

**`createAtomStore`** generates a provider component (`<Name>Provider`) for a Jotai store. This provider not only supplies the store to its child components but also handles hydrating and syncing the store's state. Here's how it works:

- **Hydration**: Hydrates atoms with initial values. It's particularly useful for SSR, ensuring that the client-side state aligns with what was rendered on the server. Use `initialValues` prop.
- **Synchronization**: Updates atoms with new values as external changes occur, maintaining consistency across the application. Use `<state>` props: there is one for each state defined in the store.

### Scoped Providers and Context Management

JotaiX creates scoped providers, enabling more granular control over different segments of state within your application. `createAtomStore` sets up a context for each store, which can be scoped using the **`scope`** prop. This is particularly beneficial in complex applications where nested providers are needed.

### Derived Atoms

There are two ways of creating derived atoms from your JotaiX store.

#### Derived Atoms Using `extend`

Atoms defined using the `extend` option are made available in the same places as other values in the store.

```ts
const { useUserStore } = createAtomStore({
  username: 'Alice',
}, {
  name: 'user',
  extend: (atoms) => ({
    intro: atom((get) => `My name is ${get(atoms.username)}`),
  }),
});

const intro = useAppStore().get.intro();
```

#### Externally Defined Derived Atoms

Derived atoms can also be defined externally by accessing the store's atoms through the `<name>Store` API. Externally defined atoms can be accessed through the store using the special `use<Name>Store().{get,set,use}.atom` hooks.

```ts
const { userStore, useUserStore } = createAtomStore({
  username: 'Alice',
}, { name: 'user' });

const introAtom = atom((get) => `My name is ${get(userStore.atom.username)}`);
const intro = useUserStore().get.atom(introAtom);
```

### Example Usage

#### 1. Create a store

```tsx
import { createAtomStore } from 'jotai-x';

export type AppStore = {
  name: string;
  onUpdateName: (name: string) => void;
};

const initialState: Nullable<AppStore> = {
  name: null,
  onUpdateName: null,
};

export const { useAppStore, AppProvider } = createAtomStore(
  initialState as AppStore,
  { name: 'app' }
);
```

#### 2. Use the store in a component

```tsx
// ...

const App = () => {
  return (
    <AppProvider 
      initialValues={{
        onUpdateName: (name: string) => console.log(name)
      }}
      // Either here or in initialValues
      name="John Doe"
    >
      <Component />
    </AppProvider>
  );
};

const Component = () => {
  const [name, setName] = useAppStore().use.name();
  const onUpdateName = useAppStore().get.onUpdateName();
  
  return (
    <div>
      <input value={name} onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)} />
      <button onClick={() => onUpdateName(name)}>Update</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### Scoped Providers

```tsx
const App = () => {
  return (
    // Parent scope
    <AppProvider 
      scope="parent"
      initialValues={{
        onUpdateName: (name: string) => console.log("Parent:", name)
      }}
      name="Parent User"
    >
      <div>
        <h1>Parent Component</h1>
        <Component />
        {/* Child scope */}
        <AppProvider 
          scope="child"
          initialValues={{
            onUpdateName: (name: string) => console.log("Child:", name)
          }}
          name="Child User"
        >
          <div>
            <h2>Child Component</h2>
            <Component />
          </div>
        </AppProvider>
      </div>
    </AppProvider>
  );
};

// Accessing state from the specified scope.
const Component = () => {
  // Here, we get the state from the parent scope
  const [name, setName] = useAppStore('parent').use.name();
  // Here, we get the state from the closest scope (default)
  const onUpdateName = useAppStore().get.onUpdateName();

  return (
    <div>
      <input value={name || ''} onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)} />
      <button onClick={() => onUpdateName(name)}>Update Name</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```
